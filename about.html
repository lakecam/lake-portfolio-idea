            <h4>
              I was born and raised on the Malaysian side of tropical Borneo
              island, a place filled with strong and vibrant colours, from the
              hornbills that would occasionally snatch my lunch from the balcony
              to the fresh and colourful flora that paraded the lush rainforest
              trees next to my house. This has influenced my sense of visual
              design through my love of bold and adventurous colours, and my
              need to add a touch of vibrancy in everything that I make.

              While some may find my plan of working in user experience design
              and finishing a university credential in interaction design ‘a bit
              much’, I enjoy learning an thinking and learning a broad array of
              principles and then immediately applying them into my job, it’s
              been rewarding and a journey that i’m excited to continue.
