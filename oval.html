            A web design project about a hypothetical Canada-based insurance
            company that aims to be cross-generational, tech-oriented, and a
            dash of fun.

                The organization that I work in is a proudly British Columbian
                insurance brokerage with over 2,500 employees who has recently
                undergone a digital awakening as well as a mass acquisition
                period, buying out other brokerages across the country.
              </p>

              <p>
                As a UX designer working in the insurance industry myself and
                having been tasked with researching and analyzing the webpages
                of not only my own organization, but also those of competitor
                organizations, it became evident to me, that insurance
                companies—both the insurance providers and the brokerages—have
                been competing to be the insurance company of choice for people
                at the tail end of the millennial generation. While some
                organizations were able to hone in on a more modern and
                simplistic aesthetic, my organization adopted a more corporate
                and legacy aesthetic, which makes sense given that my company
                was founded in the 1980s, but this visual approach may explain
                why my organization has not increased its rate of millennial
                client acquisition. Because of this, I thought it would be an
                interesting challenge to attempt a branding and responsive web
                design of a hypothetical insurance company that tried to appeal
                to millennials and, dare I say, Generation Z folks.

                While conducting discovery interviews with millennials was out
                of scope for the basis of this project, I had access to
                demographic research documents within my organization, which
                indicated a low adoption rate for ‘junior millennials’, an
                internal term used to denote millennials that are in their 30s
                and under. The further I dug into the research the more I
                realized that the competition to appeal to this demographic is
                fierce, also because of the high number of these ‘junior
                millennials’ starting families and purchasing their first homes.
                Because the research I had access to was mainly from a Canadian
                context, I decided to focus specifically on young Canadian
                families as the target demographic that this design geared
                towards.

              Since a large part of this project had to do with appealing to
              young millennial families with a large chunk of it being from a
              branding perspective, it was logical to start with curating a set
              of key characteristics to describe the direction this project was
              heading into. Based on the previous research data, as well as a
              certain degree of assumptions on my end as an insurance employee,
              I drafted a concept of what an ideal cross-generational and
              fiercely Canadian concept could be like. I then came up with key
              brand characters based on concepts that I drafted.
